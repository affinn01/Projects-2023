# Projects-2023

"Options_Pricing_Project" is a project completed in fall of 2023 with a few classmates, as a final project for our "Options Pricing and Hedging" class. In this project we constructed a Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model in R, as well as calculated the Greeks via analytical approximations or numerical methods.
